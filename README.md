# cartolafc-analytics

## Overview
This project uses data from [fbref](https://fbref.com/en/) and the official CartolaFC API to analyze fantasy football picks for the next round of the BrasileirÃ£o SÃ©rie A. 
Through a Streamlit dashboard, you can explore team and player statistics, with players grouped by position to make fantasy selection easier.
